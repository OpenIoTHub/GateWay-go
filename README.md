use Docker.

Here are the steps for each of them:

$ brew install OpenIoTHub/tap/gateway-go
```

## Running with Docker

You can also use it within a Docker container. To do that, you'll need to
execute something more-or-less like the following:

```sh
$ docker run -it --net=host openiothub/gateway-go:latest -t <your Token>
```

Note that the image will almost always have the last stable Go version.
